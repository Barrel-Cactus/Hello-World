# Hello-World
- White listing individual sites is possible within the Brave Browser.
- I created this account to resolve a problem that was bothering many people.
- The question is, How do I make this information immidiatly available to those that need it?
- Answering the question about how to whitelist one site at a time on the Brave browser
- Simply click on Brave's shield icon while in the browser
- From there, go to change global shield defaults in the drop down menu (settings)
- Click on the drop down menu labled (additional settings) and select (privacy and security.)
- Go to (Site And Shield Settings)
- Go to (view permissions and data stored across site)
- clicking on any of the sites listed should allow you to individually allow permissions that other sites will still not have
- I hope this finds you well and resolves the problems you have encountered
-
